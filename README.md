}

class  MyApp  extends  StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget  build(BuildContext context) {
    return  MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: Home(),
    );
  }
}

class  Home  extends  StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget  build(BuildContext context) {
  //Initializing UdDesign is must!
    UdDesign.init(context);
    return  Scaffold();
  }
}
```

## Responsiveness

* To make responsive design using pixel values, use **UdDesign.pixel()** and pass pixel value.

* For responsiveness you can use **UdDesign.blocksXaxis()** by passing how much screen portion you want to use in horizontal (X) axis in the range of **0% - 100%**.

* For responsiveness you can use **UdDesign.blocksYaxis()** by passing how much screen portion you want to use in vertical (Y) axis in the range of **0% - 100%**.

* For responsive font size, use  **UdDesign.fontSize()** and pass value.
